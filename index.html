      <p><b>Nike</b><br> was founded on innovation, experimentation and achieving superior athletic performance. Over time we’ve applied that innovation and passion to deliver environmentally preferred rubber formulations, water-based solvent solutions, and to eliminate excess use of chemicals by continually improving material efficiency. 

        Better chemistry is achievable, but it takes time to deliver product with equal or better performance. It requires us to be relentless in raising the bar on our expectations, and requires chemical inputs to our product innovations have maximum performance and minimal impact. 
        
        We’re committed to making products in ways that protect consumers, workers and the environment.</p>

   <p><b>adidas</b><br>  has its roots in Germany but we are a truly global company. Around the world we employ over 62,000 people. At our global HQ in Herzogenaurach, Germany, our teams are made up of people from over 100 different nations. These numbers alone can easily suggest that adidas is quite a large and also multifaceted organization. True. But we keep things simple, lean, and fast. And we will use this approach now to give an overview of what our company is all about.</p>

    <b>Converse</b><br>  has been making Chuck Taylor All Star and One Star sneakers since we started over a century ago, and now we work to make new street style classics. What you wear defines sport, street, and creative culture, and we’ve been redefining it with you all along. When you wear Converse products, you create a culture of authentic street style simply by being yourself. Whether they’re on the feet of a ‘70’s basketball star in a history book or on the street with you today, Chucks have always signified cool...because you wear them. We don’t know where you’ll go, but we know you’ll take Converse to the future with you.</p>
